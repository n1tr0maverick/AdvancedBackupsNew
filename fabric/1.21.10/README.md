This is the port for Fabric 1.21.10 (released October 6, 2025).

## Build Information
- **Version**: 3.8-1.21.10
- **Fabric Loader**: 0.16.9+
- **Fabric API**: 0.137.0+1.21.10
- **Java**: 21+

## Known Issues
⚠️ **Toast Background Rendering**: The background texture for backup progress toasts is currently disabled due to API changes in 1.21.10. Toast notifications will still appear with text and progress bars, but without the background sprite. This is a visual-only issue and does not affect backup functionality.
